- **Project2**: Configuration for managing resources in the us-east-2 region.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired project directory.
3. Initialize Terraform using `terraform init`.
4. Review and apply the configurations using `terraform apply`.
5. Make any necessary adjustments or additions to the configurations.
